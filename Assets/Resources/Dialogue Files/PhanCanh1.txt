Wanderer "..."
Merlin "And I still right{wa 0.5} haha"
Wanderer "We've lost the whole point! Can we go back to what you said earlier?"
Merlin "Oh yeah! about the fate of the world. I need your help"
Wanderer "Me? why me?"
Merlin "I saw your potential while you were fighting that monster"
Wanderer "It's just a slime..."
Merlin "Doesn't matter{wa 0.5} It's not about what you present, it's about what's within you. Who you really are. Who you could be. I can see it"
Wanderer "I..."
Merlin "Come on, don't you long to find your purpose? To discover who you truly are? Perhaps this journey... is the answer you've been waiting for"
Wanderer "..."
Merlin "And don't forget what I told you, the fate of the world is at stake. Are you really going to stand by and do nothing?"
Wanderer "Okay, you right.{wc 1} This might be my answer and for the sake of the world too"
Merlin "Yeah that spirit"
Wanderer "So Merlin"
Merlin "Yes?"
Wanderer "What should we do? Where should we go?"
Merlin "There's a powerful force calling from the north. That might be our first destination"
Wanderer "Lead the way, Merlin"
