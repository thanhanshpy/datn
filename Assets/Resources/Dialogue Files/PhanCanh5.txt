Wanderer "Where are we?"
Merlin "Can't you noticed? Of course this is the end of this maze"
Wanderer "Alright... now what?"
Merlin "Well? Got any bright ideas, genius?"
Wanderer "Uhmm... You said there's an Elden Rune in this maze, does that mean we can take it?"
Merlin "Oh wow, look who's suddenly smart. Did solving this maze wake up some of your brain cells?"
Wanderer "Cut it out already. Sure, I might not know everything, but I can still think just fine"
Merlin "Alright alright, chill out, you're just too easy to mess with, hehe"
Wanderer "And my memory still works just fine"
Merlin "Yeah, yeah, I get it, Mr. Memory Works Just Fine"
Wanderer "I'm saying this because I remember asking what we're supposed to do with these Elden Runes, and you still haven't answered"
Merlin "Oh yeah! That was me? Guess I do talk a lot"
Wanderer "Wow. And here I thought I was the one lacking intelligence"
Merlin "Honestly? I ignored your question on purpose. Figured if you kept quiet and just followed me, we'd gather more Elden Runes faster."
Wanderer "You better start explaining. If the Elden Runes were supposed to seal the Demon Lord, why are they scattered now?"
Wanderer "Don't tell me... the Demon Lord's already free? Is that what you meant by the world is in danger?"
Merlin "Relax. The world's in danger, but not like that"
Wanderer "Huh?"
Merlin "Yes, the Elden Runes were used to imprison the Demon Lord, but they're not what keeps him locked away, they only helped build the prison"
Wanderer "So how exactly is the world in danger?"
Merlin "You've seen what these Elden Runes can really do, right?"
Wanderer "Yeah, I remember. One created a living storm, another summoned a demon, and one even created a massive maze and an entire jungle!"
Merlin "Exactly. If we leave those Elden Runes lying around, some greedy fool or worse, the runes themselves could become a threat. That's why I'm gathering them. To keep them out of the wrong hands"
Wanderer "And what are you planning to do with those Elden Runes once you have them all?"
Merlin "Oh, I don't know... maybe obliterate them into dust?"
Wanderer "What? How?"
Merlin "Does it even need to be asked? Using the runes to wipe out their own kind. Poetic, isn't it?"
Wanderer "Hmmm... You're a genius!"
Merlin "Of course I am"
Merlin "Now let's move"
Wanderer "Lead the way!"
