"From obscurity came a nameless brotherhood of the bold..."
"Before the Demon King they stood, unyielding their blades drawn for every soul yet to breathe..."
"A struggle steeped in pain and silence where blood was offered, choices carved the future, and truths were forever lost to shadow..."

"They were The Forsworn Knights their sacrifice gave rise to life itself, yet beneath that rebirth lay a past forever buried in nowhere."
