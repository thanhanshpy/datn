Wanderer "What a tough fight"

Wanderer "Well, we are in a magical world so it can happen, right?"

Merlin "What?"

Wanderer "..."
Merlin "... Oh take a look at this!"
Merlin.flip(-i true)
Wanderer "What is that?"
Merlin "It fell from the storm right after you struck it down"
Wanderer "Let me guess, this is a Elden Rune?"
Merlin.flip(-i true)
Merlin "Indeed! And more importantly, having one means we can track the others more easily now"
Wanderer "Wait... there's more than one?"
Merlin "..."
Wanderer "..."
Merlin "The only thing that impresses me more than your fighting skills is how little you actually know Wanderer"
Wanderer "Of course I am, I only just learned there's something called an Elden Rune in this world"
Merlin "Guess it's my duty to teach you more about this world"
Wanderer "Right right whatever, but wait Merlin"
Merlin "Yes?"
Wanderer "So, collecting the Elden Runes is what this is all about?"
Merlin "Bingo!"
Wanderer "Why is it so important to collect all the Elden Runes?"
Merlin "We'll talk about that later. I've just detected another Elden Rune!"

Seigneur "That terrible storm has ravaged our land for so long. As the lord here, being powerless to stop it fills me with shame"
Merlin "Don't blame yourself. Even the Wanderer and I had a hard time bringing down that massive storm. We were risking our lives the whole way. Right, Wanderer?"
Wanderer.flip(-i true)
Wanderer "Huh?... {wa 1}Yeah... {wa 1}True true"
Seigneur "Would you two mighty warriors honor this old lord by sharing how you managed to overcome such a force of nature?"
Merlin "Normally, no sword can bring down a storm... but this one wasn't ordinary"
Seigneur "Oh? Really?"
Merlin "It was created by one of the Elden Runes, which contained so much energy that it formed a body of its own and it seemed to have developed a consciousness"
Seigneur "It's hard to believe... that the Elden Runes can give rise to such unimaginable creations"
Merlin "Indeed, Who would have thought that those manipulative notion Runes, meant to seal the Demon Lord, could possess such great power"
Wanderer "Who?"
Merlin "..."
Seigneur "..."
Merlin "Pardon my partner. He's not exactly full of common knowledge, but that doesn't stop him from cracking jokes constantly"
Seigneur "Oh! I see"
Wanderer "I'm not jok..."

Wanderer "Did those words really come out of his mouth?"
Merlin "Yes, well actually no, he didn't say it but come on, isn't it obvious? You help rich people, they throw money at you. That's how it works... right?"
Wanderer "..."
Merlin "Right?..."
Wanderer "I think he said the reward for saving him and his people was an invitation to some ceremony"
Merlin "You mean that ceremony we just went to? That was the reward?"
Wanderer "Yeah... seems like it, doesn't it?"
Merlin "..."
Wanderer "Hey, don't be so down. What matters most is that we saved those people, right?"
Merlin "We saved them... but who's gonna save me from starving?"
Wanderer "Those Elden Runes we're collecting, don't you think they'll lead us to something big? Like some villain's hidden treasure?"
