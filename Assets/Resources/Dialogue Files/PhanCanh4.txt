Wanderer "Wait..."
Merlin "Yes?"
Wanderer "Did you just say maze?"
Merlin "Yes...?"
Merlin "Aww, is the little Wanderer afraid of a maze?"
Wanderer "No... it just..."
Merlin "Just what? Scared you'll get lost in this maze, just like you are with yourself?"
Wanderer "What? No! Yeah, I'm scared but not for the reason you said. I've just never been in a maze before, so I'm worried I might get lost"
Merlin "Nah don't worry"
Wanderer "What do you mean? Ohhhh...."
Wanderer "You're right, we have your Elden Rune tracking skill"
Merlin "Actually no, there's too much magic surrounding this place, I can't sense the Elden Rune"
